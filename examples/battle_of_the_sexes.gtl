/* Battle of the sexes.
 *
 * Wife and husband are planning to go out: wife prefers opera while husband football match.
 * If both of them decide on opera wife will be slghtly more entertained that husband, if
 * both of them go watch footbal game, husband will be more pleased.
 *
 * If they disagree then they can:
 *  1 - both stay home,
 *  2 - go separately enjoing the evening less that if they go with partner.
 *
 * Game shows inefficiency of Nash equilibria in some cases (other kinds of equilibria might work out better).

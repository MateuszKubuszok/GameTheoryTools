/* Stag hunt.
 *
 * Hunters go catch something to eat. If both of the go after stag thet will succees and both obtain a lot
 * of meat. If one of them go after hare, he will catch it but the other one won't catch any stag - though
 * hare while more sure prey has also less meat.
 *
 * Game shows choice between profitable but not sure cooperation and sure but small prise. Even though both
 * of them should go after stag they'll choose to only every two hunts.
